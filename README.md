# Speech_Recognition
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of Speech Recognition using Python and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). It converts spoken audio into text and applies simple natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and part-of-speech tagging.

## 📌 Features

- 🎤 Convert speech to text using Python
- ✂️ Tokenize and process the text using NLTK
- 🧠 Perform Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
- 📋 Display processed output for further analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- SpeechRecognition (for audio-to-text)
- NLTK (for natural language processing)
- Pydub (for accessing the microphone)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository
